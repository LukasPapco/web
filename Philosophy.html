											<h1>What is this philosophy? <br />
											 </h1>
										</header>
										<p>	To answer this question, I invite Deleuze, Guattari and Nietzsche into this article. Mainly because of their book which surprisingly bears the name What is philosophy? Honestly to consider right answer on this question would be silly but I personally cannot imagine more accurate description of what philosophy is. 	</p>

								<p>	Perhaps we can start this journey with mentioning Ancient Greek, because somehow this is the particular place and time that come to someone’s mind when word philosophy appears. Socrates as a friend of wisdom is creating his famous equation - reason = wisdom = happiness while discussing multiple people about what is just and what is not. Dialectic is a powerful weapon when it comes to Socrates, but surprisingly being the main character in all the stories is a big advantage for making the best arguments. Is he really uncovering the truth and sharing the best wisdom for an average person whose brain would never think about such think by itself? Or is it just some kind of intrinsic ressentiment or wrath which sits deeply in Socrates’s guts because he simply envies the aristocratic way of living and he needs to create something which would prove their behaviour being unjust = stupid = evil. He got us questioning this that is without a doubt. He definitely delivers something spectacular, something that seemingly only he possesses - the concept of his own discourse which will influence all generations which succeed him.   </p>
								<p>	The concept is a key word for answering the question what philosophy is. Nevertheless, we should not give the aim or ends to whatever philosophy should discover or uncover. Let’s forget about a wisdom, let me borrow Slavoj Žižek’s words and write that wisdom is the most disgusting thing you can imagine. Well, this is maybe too harsh to write. However, what if the whole history of philosophy did not deliver any wisdom to us or did not uncover any truth. There is no being in itself, or knowable attributes of substance, there are no synthetic a priori judgements, no transcendental signifiers and no real form. Maybe we should forget about dualism and admit that the whole philosophy just creates multiple free-floating concepts. Philosophy creates things and do not uncovers them. But isn’t this all just another concept? Deleuze and Guattary says it is not and brings the term plane of immanence. It is not the concept nor the concept of all concepts. “Concepts are events, but plane is the horizon of events.” (p.36). Planes hold destinations (concepts) together. It is not a method and it is not a knowledge. Concepts are constructed while plane needs to be set up. I would not be able to deliver you this all concepts from my region unless I have the plane (and internet of course). Philosophy starts with concepts, but it gets in motion it is instituted by plane.    </p>
								<p>	I admit this all can confuse a lot. But what can explain philosophy better than bunch of weirdly constituted sentences with couple of fancy idiosyncratic words. I am playing very free and rules lacking game here. Consider this free play as an attempt to create more than to discover and both of us will be satisfied. </p>
