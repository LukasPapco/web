											<h1>Selective reading of Beyond Good and Evil<br />
											 </h1>
										</header>
										<p> The book Beyond Good and Evil is one of the most famous books written by German philosopher Fridrich Nietzsche However it is not recommended to start with Nietzsche by reading this book, as it consists of his previous thoughts and ideas and one can get lost very easily. Beyond Good and Evil simply cannot be summarized in one article. It is possible only to pick a short piece and try to interpret what could be meant by this and this sentence. In this article I am picking one topic randomly and I am trying to do what I think is the most important while reading any philosophical book – to avoid dichotomy. It is also crucial to write that this is just my thoughts while reading this masterpiece.</p>

								<p>	In the part 208 - 212 in BGE it was not clear for me how Nietzsche perceived skepticism and because he was using it to describe his notion of the "new philosopher" who will come in the future, I wanted to investigate a topic bit more precisely. I found Bett's article (2020) called "Nietzsche on the skeptics and Nietzsche as a skeptic", which explains two sides of how N's saw skepticism.  </p>
								<p>	On one hand he praises skeptics with their ability to be suspicious about any claim which argues for objective truth or truth in itself (wahrheit an sich). If philosopher writes about how the world is in a nature, then skeptics should come to strike down the whole concept and provide a good justification for this action.  </p>
								<p>	On the other hand, the methods which skeptics use can be according to N misleading too. He is using the term suspension of judgement to describe the problem. The term used by Ephectics (another name for skeptics) whose aim was to achieve Ataraxia (αταραξία). To achieve Ataraxia one has to first neither deny nor affirm anything. After becoming “clean” he is ready for a second stage and this is Ataraxia - get rid of any disturbance which cause one’s mind to be unbalanced.  This suggests the way how one can arrive to some kind of ultimate purpose. The word ultimate however is not N’s favorite.   </p>
								<p>	For instance, Descartes would suggest a kind of methodological skepticism which has its base in dismissing any prejudices and preconceptions. After you are empty of those things and you remained only with what is definitely true, then you can be skeptical about something. Exactly this is where N thinks skepticism starts to be unsuccessful. By admitting that you got rid of any kind of preconceptions you are just lying to yourself. You are not being honest, because as N believes, one cannot overcome his unconscious mind and it is not even possible for philosopher to mirror how the things are in himself. That is why N suggest for a "new philosopher" to have their opinion shaped, but at the same time they should be aware of the fact, that this is not any kind of absolute truth. This is a realization which is essential for what Nietzsche calls “free spirit”.   </p>
