										<p> My small place where I write some topics about finance which I find interesting. I will share with you a couple of learning materials that helped me to pass exams and interviews! I got my Master Business Administration diploma from University of Economics in Prague and I have 2 years experience in finance reporting for short-term rental industry and 1 year experience as a finance analyst in TCS. </p>

							<p><a href="https://lukaspapco.github.io/web//FinClass.html" class="image left"><img src="images/CorpFinance.jpeg" height = 220 alt=""  /></a>There is always a time when I need to refresh my knowledge about some topic. It is usually this feeling that the topic what I am reading somehow does not makes sense because I do not understand the concept or it contradicts what I already know, or at least I thought I knew. I am pretty sure that everyone has this. When it comes to finance, I have some tested spots (books, websites, blogs) which I always visit to refresh my knowledge. One of these are eDx, website for online courses which are made by universities and companies from all around the world. </p>

Since you know that human research would be overwhelming and it would take ages to finish, you are trying to find some clever solutions on how to get the data. In this article I will show you an example of one of my project about car industry to ilustrate how can web scraping solve your problem.</p>

							<p><a href="https://lukaspapco.github.io/web/Import.html" class="image left"><img src="images/Import2.jpeg" alt="" /></a>If you want to start with web scraping, before you get into the programming part, you should get to know some easy to use web scraping tools. <b>Import.io</b> is free and can help you even with advanced scraping. Let me show you how this helped me with my school reasearch. In my thesis I am writing about short term rental (Airbnb) and its effect on long term rental and housing prices. There were a lot of researches about how Airbnb actually influencing rental prices, but it was never done with Prague data. At the beginning of my journey I had an idea to use web scraping to get this Prague data from some real estate offering site. I had some basic programming skills and I did some small web scraping program, but to ease my work I decided to use import.io. The maximum free pages you can scrape using this software is 1000 pages per month, which was totally enough for my research. I scheduled the scraping for every Monday and after a year I had over 35 000 flat offers information from Prague market. This is how I did it.</p>
