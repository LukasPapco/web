												<h1>Super easy tool for web scraping<br />
												 </h1>
												<p></p>
											</header>
											<p> If you want to start with web scraping, before you get into the programming part, you should get to know some easy to use web scraping tools. <b>Import.io</b> is free and can help you even with advanced scraping. Let me show you how this helped me with my school reasearch. In my thesis I am writing about short term rental (Airbnb) and its effect on long term rental and housing prices. There were a lot of researches about how Airbnb actually influencing rental prices, but it was never done with Prague data. At the beginning of my journey I had an idea to use web scraping to get this Prague data from some real estate offering site. I had some basic programming skills and I did some small web scraping program, but to ease my work I decided to use import.io. The maximum free pages you can scrape using this software is 1000 pages per month, which was totally enough for my research. I scheduled the scraping for every Monday and after a year I had over 35 000 flat offers information from Prague market. This is how I did it.</p>

								<p>	After you log in into import.io you can see new extractor button in extractors field in menu. After clicking on it you can chose from Standard, Log in or Full interaction options. I personally tried only Standard option since the other two were not available. In Standard option you paste the link of website you want to scrape and then wait couple of minutes. If it will not work, then try to change your browser. For me Google Chrome always worked. After the software will load your website, you can navigate to the information you want to scrape. Usually this information is stored in html as a table so the import.io will suggest you to scrape the whole table. If it is not what you need you still can manually choose the items, you want. You can run your first try to check if everything works. Often you are not really satisfied with only one page of the website. If the website has more pages and you can see that the link is changing, for example like this: https://www.knihydobrovsky.cz/sci-fi-fantasy?currentPage=2,  you can just import a list of links into setting option in extractor. On the same page you can schedule your scraping and you successfully set your data machine. Check your results regularly because the format of the website you are scraping can change especially if it is really visited one. When the scraping is done you recieve an reminding e-mail which will tell you how succesfull the scrape is and how much data you got. After a while you can have pretty solid amount of data for your own research. </p>
