												<h1>How to keep your finance skills "fresh".<br />
												 </h1>
												<p></p>
											</header>
											<p> There is always a time when I need to refresh my knowledge about some topic. It is usually this feeling that the topic what I am reading somehow does not makes sense because I do not understand the concept or it contradicts what I already know, or at least I thought I knew. I am pretty sure that everyone has this. When it comes to finance, I have some tested spots (books, websites, blogs) which I always visit to refresh my knowledge. One of these are eDx, website for online courses which are made by universities and companies from all around the world. </p>

								<p>	Most of the time you can access all of the content for free by auditing the course but with no certificate at the end. The content length is usually like one whole semester in a school. Your online tutor will prepare you for final test by explaining the topics using short videos and questions or tasks at the end of the video. You will be provided with summaries, additional information and sources about the whole chapter that you can store for your “refreshing” times.   </p>
								<p>	Columbia University in New York on EdX prepared basic introduction to the corporate finance starting with basic theory of time value of money, capital budgeting, stocks and bonds. You don’t really need any background in finance to start this course and finishing it will give you solid base for understanding more complicated concepts. The second class covers free cash flow and how to actually calculate it with information from financial statements which you can find online. Using yahoo finance examples, you will go through a real case examples of free cash flow usage. Finally, third class will take you to the concept of risk and return and after you will be able to make a project valuation by yourself and put it into your portfolio. </p>
								<p>	If I don’t find anything in this course, I can just go back to what I call the bible of finance and that is Principle of corporate finance. Even though the book can frighten you by its thickness, it consists of multiple very well written chapters about the most important finance topics. The content is similar to the EdX course so you can easily look for some keywords in this book. It starts with a time value of money theory, stocks and bonds. Then it continues with investing strategies and risk and return concept. The last chapters are more advanced with topics like options, fusions or shake-outs. At the end of each chapter, you can find a small test, quizzes and real-life problems which you can solve with what you just learned. </p>
