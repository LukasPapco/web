									<p>Let’s say you need to get some information about specific industry in your country for a simple analysis or for a marketing purpose. Since you know that human research would be overwhelming and it would take ages to finish, you are trying to find some clever solutions on how to get the data. </p>



									<p>The one possible solution is to buy it from some of the multiple website scraping companies. The result though does not necessarily need to meet your expectation and it is hard to make some quick changes during the process. </p>


									<p>If you want to be a bit more cost efficient, you can try to scrape this data by yourself. But where to start? First think you should definitely do is to plan how your data should look like. Even if it is just the picture in your mind it will help you a lot with looking for the best solution how to get this data. Let me put this straight with a simple example of one of my projects.</p>
									<h2>Scraping companies info</h2>
									<p>The task was to get as much data about car selling companies in certain area as possible. I wanted information such as: name, location, website, review and possibly e-mail address. In this position you should immediately ask yourself, what is the best place on the internet where I can get this? If you will be super lucky, you can find a dataset with everything you need online, but this usually won’t be the case. In this example you are looking for some search engine where by giving it some keywords such as “fast food restaurants in one place” and “fast food restaurants in another place”, you will be getting your data outcome. I used Google Maps as a search engine and Google Chrome addons: <a href = "https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/instant-data-scraper/ofaokhiedipichpaobibbnahnkdoiiah" target="blank">instant data scraper</a> and <a href = "https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/data-scraper-easy-web-scr/nndknepjnldbdbepjfgmncbggmopgden"target = "blank">data miner</a>  for data scraping. Instant data miner is really simple tool for easier tasks. I am using it especially when I want to scrape only one or two pages, while data miner is a bit more advanced and you can use one of their suitable receipts specifically made for google maps. To scrape more pages for more results I set up the pagination and got as much pages as it exists. I ended up with name, reviews, address and phone number of over 13 000 car selling companies. I could not scrape e-mail address and website for some reason, so I needed to add it in a different way. With a bit of programming knowledge, you can easily scrape the first result of a google search using a google library in python. The whole process is well explained in <a href = "https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/performing-google-search-using-python-code/" target = "blank" >this article</a>. So back to the example. By using the name of car selling company you can have a solid website results and finally the website you just scraped can be used for phantombuster tool to find all the e-mails. </p>
